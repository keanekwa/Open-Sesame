# Open Sesame

One of the biggest problems students in the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) face when living in on-campus housing is the prevalance of monkeys. Students are terrorised by constant monkey attacks, including times when monkeys have interrupted tests, torn up juice boxes in the rooms, and accidentally drinking detergent leading to the monkey's own demise.

Our project seeks to provide a solution to this problem by creating auto-closing windows which close when monkey are detected by computer vision. This project was completed for our Renaissance Design module, and brings together aspects including artificial intelligence, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, CAD modelling, and 3D printing all under a single project. We attained a score of A+ for this module due to our ability to work cross-functionally across different fields of engineering.
